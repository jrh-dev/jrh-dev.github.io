# jrh-dev.github.io (messyR)

Data analyst, R developer, python enjoyer, linux user.

I like to try different tools and tech and often write guides for myself so that I can reproduce work when I inevitably forget how I did it in the first place.

I have found that teaching others is often the best way to commit something to memory and increase my own understanding. Unfortunately, my family and friends aren't always interested in learning how to set up SSH keys, or interacting with APIS. As an alternative I write short guides.
