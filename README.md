# jrh-dev.github.io (messyR)

Data analyst, R developer, python enjoyer, linux user.

I like to try different tools and tech and started writing guides for myself as an aid to learning. I have found that teaching others is often the best way to commit something to memory and increase my own understanding. Unfortunately, my family and friends arenâ€™t always interested in learning how to set up SSH keys, or interacting with API's, so as an alternative I write short guides.

My main languages are R and python, though there is certainly no shortage in materials for learning python, hence a focus here on R.
