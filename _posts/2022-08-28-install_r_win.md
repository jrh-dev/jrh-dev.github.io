R describes itself as a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a complete programming language, particularly well suited to statistical and data analysis. R is known for having a comprehensive range of packages available offering extended functionality, and for its active community.

## Downloading

Installing R on Windows 11 is simple as simple as installing any other software. Once installed we can start using R immediately from the command line or by interacting with R using the bundled GUI (Graphical User Interface).

    <strong>Information:</strong> The use of the popular RStudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment) software is so ubiquitous with R, that new users may not initially appreciate the difference between the two. Neither R nor RStudio works without installing the other. RStudio is an application to make working with R more accessible and to provide additional functionality when writing code.

We start by navigating to the [CRAN download page](https://cloud.r-project.org/index.html), choosing 'Download R for Windows', and then choosing 'base' from the options available on the next page.

The final page contains a link to download the R executable, so we click on 'Download R-X.X.X for Windows'.

    <strong>Information:</strong> CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) is a network of  servers, located around the world that, store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R.

## Installing

Once the download completes locate the downloaded file. By default downloads on Windows often go to `C:/Users/<user>/Downloads`, but this may differ if you have configured your browser to use another location.

Having located the downloaded executable, `R-X.X.X-win.exe`, we can start installation by double clicking on it.

A GUI will open to guide us through the rest of the installation. If you are new to R you will most likely want to choose the default options. More advanced users can adjust the setup as necessary.

Once the installer completes click 'Finish' and R is ready to use.

## Next Steps

Installing RStudio is often high up the priority list for users.

You can also try an alternate code editor such as VS Code.

If you are new to R you might want to try out some basic functionality.
