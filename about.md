Data analyst, R and python developer, linux user.

I like to try different tools and tech and started writing guides for myself as an aid to learning. I have found that teaching others is often the best way to commit something to memory and increase my own understanding. Unfortunately, my family and friends aren’t always interested in learning how to set up SSH keys, or interacting with API's, so as an alternative I write short guides.

My main languages are R and python, though there is certainly no shortage in materials for learning python, hence a focus here on R.
